This repo contains a list of projects featured in the AWS open source newsletter. This is new as of edition #178 of the newsletter, but I will try and back port projects when I have time.


# By technology/use case

### AI & ML

**awesome-codewhisperer**

[awesome-codewhisperer](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3cw) this repo from Christian Bonzelet is a great collection of resources for those of you who are experimenting with Generative AI coding assistants such as Amazon CodeWhisperer. This resource should keep you busy, and help you master Amazon CodeWhisperer in no time.  (#177)

**aws-inference-benchmark**
[aws-inference-benchmark ](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3cy)this project from Rustem Feyzkhanov contains code for running deep learning inference benchmarks on different AWS instances and service types. Check out his post, [Making LLMs Scalable: Cloud Inference with AWS Fargate and Copilot](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3d0) where Rustem shows you in more details how you can use this repo. (#177)

**gen-ai-on-eks**

[gen-ai-on-eks](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3d2) this repository aims to showcase how to finetune a FM model in Amazon EKS cluster using, JupyterHub to provision notebooks and craft both serving and training scripts, RayOperator to manage Ray Clusters and Karpenter to manage Node Scaling. (#177)

**makit-llm-lambda**

[makit-llm-lambda ](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3cx)this repo from Martyn Kilbryde is an example of how you can run a Large Language Model (LLM) inside an AWS Lambda Function.  Whilst the code will help you deploy to AWS Lambda, it can be ran locally inside Docker for testing as well. The function contains the full LLM model and the code to use the model, allowing basic text generation from a HTTP call into it. (#177)

**multi-tenant-chatbot-using-rag-with-amazon-bedrock**

[multi-tenant-chatbot-using-rag-with-amazon-bedrock](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3c5) provides a solution for building a multi-tenant chatbot with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG is a common pattern where a general-purpose language model is queried with a user question along with additional contextual information extracted from private documents. To help you understand and deploy the code, check out the supporting blog post from Farooq Ashraf, Jared Dean, and Ravi Yadav, [Build a multi-tenant chatbot with RAG using Amazon Bedrock and Amazon EKS](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3c6) (#177)

**quarkus-bedrock-demo**

[quarkus-bedrock-demo](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3cv) This is a sample project from my colleague Denis Traub, based on [work from Vini](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3b2)  , that demonstrates how to access Amazon Bedrock from a Quarkus application deployed on AWS Lambda. (#177)


### Data & Big Data

**aws-data-solutions-framework**

[aws-data-solutions-framework](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-data-solutions-framework) is a framework for implementation and delivery of data solutions with built-in AWS best practices. AWS Data Solutions Framework (DSF) is an abstraction atop AWS services based on AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) L3 constructs, packaged as a library. You can leverage AWS DSF to implement your data platform in weeks rather than in months. AWS DSF is available in TypeScript and Python. Use the framework to build your data solutions instead of building cloud infrastructure from scratch. Compose data solutions using integrated building blocks via Infrastructure as Code (IaC), that allow you to benefit from smart defaults and built-in AWS best practices. You can also customize or extend according to your requirements. Check out the dedicated documentation page, complete with examples to get you started. (#178)

### Databases

**sso-sync-to-amazon-rds**

[sso-sync-to-amazon-rds](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3e2) This project sets up AWS Lambda functions, Amazon EventBridge rule, Amazon VPC Endpoint for AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On), the related Security Groups and permissions necessary to automatically provision database users to the Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) cluster using AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK). When a new user is created in IAM Identity Center and the user belongs to the group specified in a IAM_IDC_GROUP_NAME variable, EventBridge rule will trigger the Lambda function. The Lambda function will create a new user in a specified Amazon RDS cluster. The user will then be able to login to the database using their SSO username and IAM credentials. Adding a user to the configured group will trigger the Lambda function as well. (#178)

### Developer Tools

**localstack-aws-cdk-example**

[localstack-aws-cdk-example](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3dw) This repo aims to showcase the usage of [Localstack](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3dx) and AWS CDK to address specific integration challenges regarding local development where the end target is the AWS platform. If you are unfamiliar with Localstack, it is an open source, fully functional local AWS cloud stack that allows you to develop and test your cloud and Serverless apps offline. (#178)

### Governance & Risk

**aws-control-tower-controls-cdk**

[aws-control-tower-controls-cdk](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3e3) This pattern describes how to use AWS CloudFormation and AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) to implement and administer preventive, detective, and proactive AWS Control Tower controls as infrastructure as code (IaC). A control (also known as a guardrail) is a high-level rule that provides ongoing governance for your overall AWS Control Tower environment. For example, you can use controls to require logging for your AWS accounts and then configure automatic notifications if specific security-related events occur. Check out the REAMDE for more details on what you can do with this. (#178)

**observability-solution-kit**

[observability-solution-kit](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3d3) this repository is the Ollyv sdk. The Ollyv sdk offers a simple way to configure its behaviour through *.properties files, which are environment-specific.

### Java, Kotlin, Scala, OpenJDK

**powertools-lambda-kotlin**

[powertools-lambda-kotlin](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3dv) This project demonstrates the Lambda for Powertools Kotlin module deployed using Serverless Application Model with Gradle running the build. This example is configured for Java 8 only; in order to use a newer version, check out the Gradle configuration guide in the main project README. You can also use sam init to create a new Gradle-powered Powertools application - choose to use the AWS Quick Start Templates, and then Hello World Example with Powertools for AWS Lambda, Java 17 runtime, and finally gradle. (#178)

### Networking

**trading-latency-benchmark**

[trading-latency-benchmark](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3d1) This repository contains a network latency test stack that consists of Java based trading client and Ansible playbooks to coordinate distributed tests. Java based trading client is designed to send limit and cancel orders, allowing you to measure round-trip times of the network communication. (#177)

### Security

**sso-sync-to-amazon-rds**

[sso-sync-to-amazon-rds](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3e2) This project sets up AWS Lambda functions, Amazon EventBridge rule, Amazon VPC Endpoint for AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On), the related Security Groups and permissions necessary to automatically provision database users to the Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) cluster using AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK).

**resource-explorer-with-organizations**

[resource-explorer-with-organizations](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3dy) you may have a use cases where you are eager to find lingering resources, or resources that were not at their optimal settings. By utilising Resource Explorer and Step Functions, you can gather all the necessary information from these accounts, and use them to create a report to gain a wider understanding of the state of your AWS accounts. As of this release, the limitation of Resource Explorer is that it is done on a per account basis. However, the README provides details of a workaround to deploy this to all your accounts in our AWS Organization using StackSets. The use case shown in the repo shows you how you can find resources in an multiple AWS accounts over multiple regions, and generating an Excel Document displaying the Account it belongs to, Name, Resource Type, and ARN of the resource. The repo provides details of how you can deploy this tool, so make sure you check that out too. (#178)
