**aws-advanced-nodejs-wrapper**

[aws-advanced-nodejs-wrapper](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/465) is complementary to an existing NodeJS driver and aims to extend the functionality of the driver to enable applications to take full advantage of the features of clustered databases such as Amazon Aurora.  In other words, the AWS Advanced NodeJS Wrapper does not connect directly to any database, but enables support of AWS and Aurora functionalities on top of an underlying NodeJS driver of the user's choice. Hosting a database cluster in the cloud via Aurora is able to provide users with sets of features and configurations to obtain maximum performance and availability, such as database failover. However, at the moment, most existing drivers do not currently support those functionalities or are not able to entirely take advantage of it. The main idea behind the AWS Advanced NodeJS Wrapper is to add a software layer on top of an existing NodeJS driver that would enable all the enhancements brought by Aurora, without requiring users to change their workflow with their databases and existing NodeJS drivers.

**evaluating-large-language-models-using-llm-as-a-judge**

[evaluating-large-language-models-using-llm-as-a-judge](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3vz) This lab addresses this challenge by providing a practical solution for evaluating LLMs using LLM-as-a-Judge with Amazon Bedrock. This is relevant for developers and researchers working on evaluating LLM based applications. In the notebook you are guided using MT-Bench questions to generate test answers and evaluate them with a single-answer grading using the Bedrock API, Python and Langchain.

Evaluating large language models (LLM) is challenging due to their broad capabilities and the inadequacy of existing benchmarks in measuring human preferences. To address this, strong LLMs are used as judges to evaluate these models on more open-ended questions. The agreement between LLM judges and human preferences has been verified by introducing two benchmarks: Multi Turn (MT)-bench, a multi-turn question set, and Chatbot Arena, a crowdsourced battle platform. The results reveal that strong LLM judges can match both controlled and crowdsourced human preferences well, achieving over 80% agreement, the same level of agreement between humans This makes LLM-as-a-judge a scalable and explainable way to approximate human preferences, which are otherwise very expensive to obtain. (#197)

**fmbench-orchestrator**

[fmbench-orchestrator](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/467) this repo is a tool designed to automate the deployment and management of FMBench for benchmarking on Amazon EC2, Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock. In case of benchmarking on EC2, we could benchmark on multiple instances simultaneously, and these instances can be of different instance types (so you could run g6e, p4de and a trn1 instances via the same config file), in different AWS regions and also test multiple FMBench config files. This orchestrator automates the creation of Security Groups, Key Pairs, EC2 instances, runs FMBench for a specific config, retrieves the results, and shuts down the instances after completion. Thus it simplifies the benchmarking process (no more manual creation of SageMaker Notebooks, EC2 instances and cleanup, downloading results folder) and ensures a streamlined and scalable workflow.

**aws-waf-for-event-analysis-dashboard**

[aws-waf-for-event-analysis-dashboard](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3ls) finding the information you need during security incidents is what this project aims to help with. During major online events like live broadcasts, security teams need a fast and clear understanding of attack patterns and behaviours to distinguish between normal and malicious traffic flows. The solution outlined here allows filtering flow logs by "Client IP", "URI", "Header name", and "Header value" to analyse these fields and pinpoint values specifically associated with attack traffic versus normal traffic. For example, the dashboard can identify the top header values that are atypical for normal usage. The security team can then create an AWS WAF rule to block requests containing these header values, stopping the attack. This project demonstrates using AWS Glue crawlers to categorise and structure WAF flow log data and Amazon Athena for querying. Amazon Quicksight is then employed to visualise query results in a dashboard. Once deployed, the dashboard provides traffic visualisation similar to the example graphs shown in Images folder in under project , empowering security teams with insight into attacks and defence.(#186)

**fmbench-orchestrator**

[fmbench-orchestrator](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/467) this repo is a tool designed to automate the deployment and management of FMBench for benchmarking on Amazon EC2, Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock. In case of benchmarking on EC2, we could benchmark on multiple instances simultaneously, and these instances can be of different instance types (so you could run g6e, p4de and a trn1 instances via the same config file), in different AWS regions and also test multiple FMBench config files. This orchestrator automates the creation of Security Groups, Key Pairs, EC2 instances, runs FMBench for a specific config, retrieves the results, and shuts down the instances after completion. Thus it simplifies the benchmarking process (no more manual creation of SageMaker Notebooks, EC2 instances and cleanup, downloading results folder) and ensures a streamlined and scalable workflow. Very detailed README that provides much more details on how this works. (#205)
