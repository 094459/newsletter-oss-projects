Richard wrote about this repo in his write up [Start building my AWS Clean Rooms lab](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3j6), which you should read to help you get started. This is a work in progress, but there is still a lot of stuff to get stuck into so worth checking out if AWS Clean Rooms is something that you are exploring. (#183)

**big-data-summarization-using-griptape-bedrock-redshift**

[big-data-summarization-using-griptape-bedrock-redshift](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3gv) I have looked at Griptape in other blog posts, so it was nice to see this repo that provides sample code and instructions for a Big data summarisation example using this popular open-source library, together with Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Redshift. In this sample,  TitanXL LLM is used to summarise but Anthropic's Claude v2 is also used to drive the application. This application sample demonstrates how data can be pulled from Amazon Redshift and then passed to the summarisation model. The driving model is isolated from the actual data and uses the tools provided to it to orchestrate the application. (#181)

**gen-ai-on-eks**

[gen-ai-on-eks](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3d2) this repository aims to showcase how to finetune a FM model in Amazon EKS cluster using, JupyterHub to provision notebooks and craft both serving and training scripts, RayOperator to manage Ray Clusters and Karpenter to manage Node Scaling. (#177)

**get-the-news-rss-atom-feed-summary**

[get-the-news-rss-atom-feed-summary](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3l6) is a fantastic demo that demonstrates some of the capabilities that using large language models can help you introduce into your applications. The demo code provides a summary of the most recent news from an RSS or Atom feed using Amazon Bedrock. (#185)


**golang-url-shortener**

[golang-url-shortener](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3j3) is a project that you can build from Furkan Gulsen that deploys a URL shortener service, built with Go and Hexagonal Architecture, leverages a serverless approach for efficient scalability and performance. It uses a variety of AWS services to provide a robust, maintainable, and highly available URL shortening service. Are URL Shortners the new todo app? Not sure but I really like the quality of the documentation of this project, and like I did last year with implementing a serverless web analytics solution, I am going to check this project out and see if it would be a good replacement for the tool I currently use, YOURLS. Check out the discussion on reddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/18nnfix/url_shortener_hexagonal_serverless_architecture/).(#183)

**makit-llm-lambda**

[makit-llm-lambda ](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3cx)this repo from Martyn Kilbryde is an example of how you can run a Large Language Model (LLM) inside an AWS Lambda Function.  Whilst the code will help you deploy to AWS Lambda, it can be ran locally inside Docker for testing as well. The function contains the full LLM model and the code to use the model, allowing basic text generation from a HTTP call into it. (#177)

**reinvent-session-concierge**

[reinvent-session-concierge](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3gq) is potentially a very useful tool for those of you heading out to re:Invent, and wanting to make sure that you make the most of your time there by attending the sessions of most interest to you. This project uses Amazon Bedrock Titan text embeddings stored in a PostgreSQL database to enable generative AI queries across the re:Invent session data. It combines both semantic search and traditional queries. I am going to be trying it out later today to help me plan my online viewing. (#181)

**serverless-rss-filtered-feed-gen**

[serverless-rss-filtered-feed-gen](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3dz) This is a configurable serverless solution that generates filtered rss feeds and makes them public accessible. Defined RSS sources are read at a given interval and new filtered feeds are generated and stored. The architecture uses a minimum number of AWS services to keep it easy to maintain and cost-effective. (#178)

**youtube-video-summarizer-with-bedrock**

[youtube-video-summarizer-with-bedrock](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3j7) is a example project from Zied Ben Tahar that uses large language models to create a YouTube video summariser, allowing you to sift through You Tube videos and get an high level summary of them, allowing you to make better decisions as to whether you want to spend more time watching the video.  Zied has also put together a supporting blog post, [AI powered video summariser with Amazon Bedrock](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3j8) that provides everything you need to get this project up and running for yourself.
